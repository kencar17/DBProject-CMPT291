Vehicles come in many different types, and each type needs to have a different daily, weekly, and monthly rates. To accommodate this, logged-in employees can  create new vehicle types or update existing vehicle types. To begin using the vehicle type system, make sure you're [logged in](gs.md) select Car Types from the employee home screen. You will be presented with the following screen:

It will then update the vehicle type stored in the system, and let you know when the operation is completed.
